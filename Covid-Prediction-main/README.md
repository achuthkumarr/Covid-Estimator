# COVID-PREDICTION

Estimating constant information involving Machine Learning has demonstrated its importance in anticipating that better results should further develop future direction. ML models have been utilized in numerous application regions that require acknowledgment and emphasization of destructive angles. In this study we have attempted to utilize Machine Learning models to conjecture forthcoming COVID-19 cases in India, believing the issue to be a consuming subject at this time. As a general rule, Two Machine Learning models, Random Forest Regressor and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models have been talked about to gauge the quantity of active cases for the following 30 days. The outcomes delivered by the review demonstrate it is a decent strategy to involve these models for the forecast of the COVID-19 pandemic.
